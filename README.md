This scheduler is designed for small businesses in the service industry (i.e. plumbing companies, hvac, electricians). There is always a need for an easy to use and reliable scheduler. I engineered this scheduler so the company can simply add an api of their employees and the rest of the work was taken care of. 

**How it Works**
- The dropdown feature lets you select an employee. 
- After selecting an employee, you can add Job Notes. These notes can consist of appointment location, name of clientele, and any other details that will help the technician do his/her job. 
- After drafting job notes, you can select a start and stop date/time for the specified job. The default date is the current date you are using the scheduler. This makes it easy for any 3rd party or receptionist that is scheduling multiple jobs per day. 
- Finally there is the calendar that shows you all the scheduled jobs. Again, the default setting is the current day, to make it easy for the person scheduling to add same day jobs. There are multiple views like month, week, day, and agenda.

**Future Updates**
- I am in the process of creating an on-click modal for each scheduled job. So when you click on a job on the calendar, a modal pops up with the job descriptions. This will make it easy for the technician to check out his/her job details while he/she is out for the day.
- There will soon be a login feature that will allow multiple companies to use the software and have their calendar data saved to a database.
